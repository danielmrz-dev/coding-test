## Projects requirements
- An input field for filtering users by their name, equipped with real-time search capabilities ✅
- Action Button: A button labeled “Fetch Users” to initiate the API request. ✅
- Table Element: An element to display user data, with columns for “Name”, “Username”, “Email”, “Phone”, “City”, and “Company”. ✅
- Utilize the public API JSONPlaceholder https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/usersto retrieve the user list when the “Fetch Users” button is activated. The data
fetched should be stored in an array of user objects. ✅
- Dynamic Table Generation: Automatically generate and populate the table with rows for each user retrieved from the API. Each row should display the user’s name, username, email, phone, city (from address.city), and company name. ✅
- Filter Function: Implement a function to filter the displayed users as the user types into the input field. This should update the table rows in real-time, displaying only users whose names match the input. ✅
- Implement robust error handling for the API request: Display a clear error message in the UI if the API request fails or if any issues occur during the data fetching process. ✅
- Advanced Features (Optional but Recommended) Implement sorting capabilities on the table headers (e.g., sort users by name, email, etc.). Allow users to select a specific user and display more detailed information in a modal or separate section. ✅
- Add pagination to manage the display of a large number of users efficiently. ✅
